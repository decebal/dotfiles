- npm/yarn (packages, scripts)
- Homebrew (formulae)

#### 📁 **Organized Structure**
```
.dotfiles/
├── common/       → Shared configs
├── zsh/          → Zsh specific
├── vim/          → Vim setup
├── git/          → Git configs
└── local/        → Your secrets (gitignored)
```

#### 🧪 **Health Check**
One command to validate everything:
```bash
./health-check.sh
```
Checks:
- ✅ Shell installation
- ✅ Required tools
- ✅ Plugin status
- ✅ Configuration integrity

---

- 🔑 SSH key protection patterns

**Safe by default:**
```bash
# Local configs never get committed
~/.dotfiles/local/secrets.sh  # ✅ Gitignored
~/.dotfiles/local/*.key       # ✅ Gitignored
```

---

### 7. **Performance Optimized**

**Fast startup:**
- ⚡ Lazy loading of plugins
- 🎯 Conditional feature loading

## 💭 Why This Architecture?

### Dual Configuration System
- **Problem**: AI assistants struggle with complex prompts and heavy plugins
- **Solution**: Automatic detection and minimal config for AI contexts

### Git Submodules for Plugins
- **Problem**: Plugin updates break things
- **Solution**: Version-controlled plugins, update when ready

### Local Directory for Secrets
- **Problem**: Accidentally commit credentials
- **Solution**: Gitignored local/ directory for all secrets

### Health Check Script
- **Problem**: Silent failures in shell config
- **Solution**: Comprehensive validation on demand
