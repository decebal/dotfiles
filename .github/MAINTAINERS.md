# Maintainers Guide

Quick reference for repository maintainers.

## üöÄ Release Process

### Automated Releases (Recommended)

1. **Contributors create changesets**
   ```bash
   bun run changeset
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions creates Release PR**
   - Triggered on push to `master`
   - Automatically aggregates all changesets
   - Updates version and CHANGELOG

3. **Review Release PR**
   - Check version bump is correct
   - Review CHANGELOG entries
   - Verify all changesets are included

4. **Merge Release PR**
   - Creates git tag
   - Publishes GitHub release
   - Updates CHANGELOG

### Manual Release (Emergency)

```bash
# 1. Version packages
bun run version

# 2. Review changes
git diff

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: version packages"

# 4. Tag
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
git tag -a "v$VERSION" -m "Release v$VERSION"

# 5. Push
git push && git push --tags

# 6. Create GitHub release manually
```

## üìù Common Tasks

### Reviewing PRs

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass (both normal and AI agent modes)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changeset included (if needed)
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] No security issues

### Merging PRs

```bash
# Use GitHub's "Squash and merge" for feature PRs
# Use "Rebase and merge" for Release PRs
```

### Managing Issues

**Labels:**
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `question` - Further information requested
- `wontfix` - Will not be worked on

### Triaging Issues

1. **Verify** - Can you reproduce?
2. **Label** - Apply appropriate labels
3. **Respond** - Ask for more info if needed
4. **Prioritize** - Set milestone if critical

## üîí Security

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Email maintainers directly
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories
3. Wait for fix before disclosure

### Security Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in codebase
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities

## üìä Metrics & Health

### Repository Health

```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
bun outdated

# Run health check
./health-check.sh

# Test startup time
time zsh -i -c exit
```

### Community Health

- Issue response time
- PR review time
- Contributor activity
- Star growth

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Release PR Not Created

# Try again
```
