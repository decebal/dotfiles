# Dotfiles Repository Context

This is a personal dotfiles repository for managing shell configurations (bash/zsh), vim settings, and development tools.

## Repository Structure
- `/bash/` - Bash-specific configurations and completions
- `/zsh/` - Zsh configurations including oh-my-zsh framework
- `/common/` - Shared configurations between shells (aliases, functions, paths)
- `/vim/` - Vim configurations and plugins
- `/git/` - Git configuration files
- `/local/` - Machine-specific local configurations (not tracked in git)

## Key Configuration Files
- `zsh/zshrc` - Main Zsh configuration
- `common/aliases` - Shell aliases
- `common/functions` - Shell functions
- `common/paths` - PATH configurations
- `common/zsh-config` - Zsh-specific settings

## Active Shell Framework
- Oh-My-Zsh with plugins: git, gitfast, zsh-syntax-highlighting, history-substring-search, direnv, zsh-autosuggestions
- Oh-My-Posh prompt with material theme
- Powerline theme support

## Development Tools Configured
- NVM (Node Version Manager)
- PyEnv (Python Version Manager)
- GVM (Go Version Manager)
- pnpm, yarn package managers
- Terraform
- Docker/Rancher Desktop
- Windsurf IDE

## Important Conventions
1. Machine-specific configs go in `/local/` directory
2. Common settings shared between shells in `/common/`
3. Environment variable `DOTFILES` points to `~/.dotfiles`
4. Support for both server and desktop environments

## When Making Changes
- Test compatibility with both bash and zsh
- Preserve existing PATH and environment configurations
- Check for existence of files/commands before sourcing/executing
- Maintain compatibility with existing tools (nvm, pyenv, etc.)
